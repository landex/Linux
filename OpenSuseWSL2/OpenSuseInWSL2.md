# OpenSuse in WSL2

Afters conclude the configuration initial configuration of **OpenSuse** in **WSDL** and open the terminal, the current aparece is this.

```bash
yourusername@yourmachinename:/mnt/c/Users/yourusername>
```

The default *Shell* is bash, see the output below.

```bash
yourusername@yourmachinename:/mnt/c/Users/yourusername> echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
yourusername@yourmachinename:/mnt/c/Users/yourusername>
```
The first thing that is necessary to make after install **OpenSuse** is update the installed packages.

```bash
yourusername@yourmachinename:/mnt/c/Users/yourusername> sudo zypper update
```
If your run and is returned this output below, indicate that your system was updated.

```bash
yourusername@yourmachinename:/mnt/c/Users/yourusername> sudo zypper update
[sudo] password for root:
Loading repository data...
Reading installed packages...
Nothing to do.
yourusername@yourmachinename:/mnt/c/Users/yourusername>
```

Ok then, now our system was updated and ready for us start the configurations.

The first thing that I like to make is change the default shell from ***bash*** to ***zshell***. But before we need install the ***GIT***

# GIT

Run command below to install ***Git***.

```bash

```

# ZSHELL
